### Groups

Being in a group means having a cohesive game theme and story. It **does not** mean using other team member's code and repurposing it as your own. Each person's contributions must be utterly unique.

There are things that are allowed to be copied. These are exampled of things that will not be marked as part of your contribution:
- Images and game assets
- The drawing of specific game characters or scenery

If you do copy someone else's code in this regard, you *must* give them an attribution with a comment as follows.

```python
# Written by Dave D.
# dave_cpt.py
for x in range(100, 500, 50):
    pygame.draw.rect(....)
# ------------------
```

## Requirements
- Use of classes
    - Attributes and behaviours
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Interaction between multiple objects
- Algorithms
    - Searching
    - Sorting
    - Filtering
    - More credit for searching/sorting/filtering based on complicated criteria (not simply on integers).
        - E.g., Filtering a client list based on city, age, and last name.
- Formatting and naming conventions
    - This includes docstrings.

## Submission
Only one person will sumbit on behalf of the entire group.

### Demo Video
**Each group** is to submit one demonstration video (five minutes long) to showcase and explain the application (no code).

### Code explanation video
**Each member** is to submit a five minute explanation of their own code and how it works. You must find examples of each of the topics in the requirements. If you have too many to show, just show your best work. **The video's filename *must* include your full name.**

**Please note:** The code explanation video is supposed to be an explanation of your code and how it works. You must use technical language to show me you know what these concepts are. This is not a video where you only say "here is a function I wrote".

### GitHub code
Be sure to constantly update your GitHub repository.
